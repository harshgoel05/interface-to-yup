# Interface-to-Yup
Interface-to-Yup is an open-source project that streamlines the process of creating Yup validation schemas from TypeScript interfaces and JSON objects. Yup is a JavaScript schema validation library that helps you validate and sanitize data according to your defined schema.

Converting TypeScript interfaces or JSON objects into Yup validation schemas manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Interface-to-Yup simplifies this process by automatically generating Yup schemas based on your input interfaces or JSON objects, saving you valuable development time and reducing the chances of introducing bugs in your validation logic.
